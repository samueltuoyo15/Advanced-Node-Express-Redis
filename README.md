# Advanced Node.js Concepts

This project explores advanced concepts in Node.js, including buffers, the event loop, streams, and advanced CORS configurations in Express.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies for each module:

    ```bash
    cd buffers
    npm install
    cd ../event-loop
    npm install
    cd ../streams
    npm install
    cd ../express-concepts/advanced-cors
    npm install
    cd ../../..
    ```

## Usage

Each module in this project demonstrates a specific concept. Hereâ€™s how you can run each one:

### Buffers

Navigate to the `buffers` directory and run:

```bash
cd buffers
npm run dev
```

This will execute the `index.ts` file, showcasing the use of buffers for handling binary data.

### Event Loop

Navigate to the `event-loop` directory and run:

```bash
cd event-loop
npm run dev
```

This will execute the `index.ts` file, demonstrating the Node.js event loop's behavior and execution order.

### Streams

Navigate to the `streams` directory and run:

```bash
cd streams
npm run dev
```

This will execute the `index.ts` file, showcasing the use of streams for efficient data processing, compression, and encryption.

### Express CORS

Navigate to the `express-concepts/advanced-cors` directory and run:

```bash
cd express-concepts/advanced-cors
npm run dev
```

This will start an Express server that demonstrates advanced CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration.
